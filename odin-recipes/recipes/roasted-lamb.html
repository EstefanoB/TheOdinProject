        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move oven rack to the center position.</li>
            <li> In a large bowl, combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. 
                Toss in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li> Season the rack all over with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven 
                proof skillet over high heat. Sear rack of lamb for 1 to 2 minutes on all sides. Set aside for a 
                few minutes. Brush rack of lamb with the mustard. Roll in the bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. 
                Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
            <li> Arrange the rack bone side down in the skillet. Roast the lamb in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes, 
                depending on the degree of doneness you want. With a meat thermometer, take a reading in the center of 
                the meat after 10 to 12 minutes and remove the meat, or let it cook longer, to your taste. Let it rest 
                for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered, before carving between the ribs.</li>
